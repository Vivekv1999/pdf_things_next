# Video Script: Multi-Account SKU Normalization for Meesho Sellers

## 📹 Video Title
**"Sort Meesho Labels from Multiple Accounts in One Click - Multi-Account SKU Normalization Tutorial"**

## 📝 Video Description (For YouTube/Social Media)

```
Struggling to sort Meesho labels when you have multiple seller accounts? 

This feature solves the biggest problem for multi-account Meesho sellers: SKU normalization across different accounts!

🎯 THE PROBLEM:
When you have multiple Meesho seller accounts, each account might use different SKU prefixes:
- Account 1: "seller1-PRODUCT"
- Account 2: "seller2-PRODUCT"  
- Account 3: "alt-PRODUCT"

Even though they're the SAME product, they won't sort together because the prefixes are different! This means wasted time manually organizing your labels.

✨ THE SOLUTION:
Our Multi-Account SKU Normalization feature lets you define replacement rules to normalize all your SKUs to one main account pattern. All SKUs then sort together perfectly!

🚀 FEATURES:
✅ Support unlimited seller accounts
✅ Custom SKU replacement rules
✅ Automatic save - rules persist between sessions
✅ Visual preview of transformations
✅ One-click sorting across all accounts
✅ Save hours of manual work

## 🎬 FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### SCENE 1: INTRO & HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Visual: Show messy PDF with labels from different accounts mixed up]**

**Narration:**
> "If you're a Meesho seller managing multiple accounts, you know the frustration of sorting labels. Different account prefixes mean your labels are all mixed up, even for the same product. Today, I'll show you how to fix this in seconds with our Multi-Account SKU Normalization feature."

### SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM EXPLAINED (0:30 - 1:15)

**[Visual: Show 3 seller accounts with different SKU formats]**

> "Account 2 uses: 'seller2-RedDress-M'"
> 
> "Account 3 uses: 'alt-RedDress-M'"

**[Visual: Highlight that it's the SAME product]**

> "These are the SAME product - a Red Dress in size Medium. But when you try to sort them alphabetically, they don't group together because of the different prefixes."

**[Visual: Show alphabetical sorting putting them far apart]**

> "seller1-RedDress-M"
> "seller2-RedDress-M" 
> "alt-RedDress-M"

> "This means you're manually hunting through your labels to find matching products. That's a huge waste of time!"
